# Final_Project
The students are required to specify and design in UML and implement in Java a distributed application , with a graphical user interface , which is described below.
The client side of the application must be written in Java (possibly an applet running inside a standard browser ),while the server-side of the application can be implemented in Java and/or with other web technology. The server must use a database to access the data.
The techniques for client-server communication are chosen by the student (typically, Sockets or RMI).

Specification :
The application has the following behavior. .
A customer can select a computer on the web page of a producer . Computers are classified into servers, desktops and laptops. The customer can select a standard configuration or can interactively define the desired configuration . The configurable components ( for example, the memories ) are presented in a list of available options. The customer can get an estimate of the cost of each machine configuration . To order , the customer must provide the information for delivery and payment. The methods of payment are: credit card , cash , bank transfer.
Once the order has been placed , the system sends an e-mail confirmation to the customer with the order details . The client, while waiting for the arrival of the computer, may at any time check online the status of hiss/her order and may cancel the order if the goods have not been shipped yet. The information system verifies the customer solvency , requires the configuration ordered at the warehouse, prints the invoice, and sends the request to the warehouse for shipping , while also handling the cancellation of orders.
Extend or suitably complement the specifications where necessary ( for example , in the choice of the number and type of configurable components , etc. ) .

Tools:
The testing phase must be planned and documented using the Junit plugin of Eclipse. It is also strongly suggested the use of SVN, or other Configuration Management tools.
Documentation:
No user manual is required. You should prepare at least one document , even brief , for each phase of the life cycle of the SW from requirements to testing. Use UML
whenever possible, using at least a Class diagrams and for the program's architecture and Sequence Diagrams to illustrate the behavior.
.

Presentation:
The solution proposed by the students will be presented, BY APPOINTMENT WITH THE INSTRUCTOR. The complete source code must be emailed to the instructor before the presentation.
The presentation is exclusively based on an oral presentation, using Powerpoint-style slides (also Libreoffice etc are fine). Transparencies can also be displayed via PC.
A short demonstration of the correct operation of the application is required, also to illustrate the effective use of tools like JUnit or SVN. the contribution of each participant in the project must be clearly stated.
